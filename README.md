# syde575

Labs for the Image Processing course at the University of Waterloo

## Description

Beginning with a discussion of quantitative models of imaging systems, this course moves on to apply methods of linear systems theory and signal processing to image processing. Simple spatial domain techniques as well as spatial frequency domain methods and digital filter design for image enhancement and restoration are discussed. The key methods and problems are surveyed: edge detection, image denoising, image segmentation, image enhancement, image compression, image registration, and feature detection. Applications to machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging will be emphasized. [Offered: F]
